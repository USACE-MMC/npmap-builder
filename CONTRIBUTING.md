# Beta Testing

If you are a beta tester, please read the following instructions.

## Introduction

First of all, thanks for helping test the Builder!

Keep in mind that the Builder is a work-in-progress. We are following the mantra of "release early and often" in hopes that we can use real world feedback to guide our development.

A few key points:

- Please _do not_ send feedback via email. Submit all feedback through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/npmap-builder/issues).
- We have created [an issue](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/npmap-builder/issues/9) specifically for beta feedback. Please use it to submit any general feedback to the team.
- If you run into an issue or have a _specific_ enhancement request, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/npmap-builder/issues/new). Before doing this, take a look at the existing issues to ensure you aren't creating a duplicate request. If your request already has its own issue, do not create a new one. Simply comment on the existing one, using "+1" comments to show your support for an existing issue.

## Support

The NPMap team is here to help you get the most out the beta test. We will answer any and all open issues as quickly as possible.

## Data

If you need help getting your data into a format that is compatible with the Builder, open a data support request in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/npmap-builder/issues). The NPMap team will provide limited data support during the beta.
